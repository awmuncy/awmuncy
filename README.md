### Allen Muncy ðŸ‘‹

(he/him/his)

I am a full stack dev, and I rather enjoy building web applications. PWAs have a special place in my heart.

TypeScript and JavaScript are home to me, and I have building using React for close to 7 years now. I'm as comfortable building DevOps pipelines as I am building web applications, and as comfortable with Mongo as I am with SQL. 

You can reach me at allen@allenmuncy.com, or @AllenMuncy on X (formerly Twitter).
